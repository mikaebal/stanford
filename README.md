<h1>Stanford Code in Place</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository contains all the programming challenges and my final project completed during the Stanford Code in Place program, organized by week. These tasks focus on foundational programming concepts using Python, including problem-solving, control flow, data structures, interactive graphical programs, console programming, and debugging code. 

</br>Each weekâ€™s folder includes both the source code and supplementary materials, such as images or videos demonstrating the program's output. Through a progressive, week-by-week learning approach, I deepened my understanding of Python and applied these skills to create a comprehensive final project that integrates everything I learned.
