<h1>Stanford Code in Place</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository includes all programming challenges and the final project from the Stanford Code in Place program, organized by week. The tasks cover foundational Python concepts such as problem-solving, control flow, data structures, and debugging.

</br>The progressive learning approach enhanced my Python skills, culminating in a final project that integrates all concepts learned.
