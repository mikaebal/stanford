<h1>Stanford Code in Place</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository contains all the coding assignments completed during the Stanford Code in Place course, organized by week. These assignments focus on foundational programming concepts using Python, including problem-solving, control structures, functions, and more. Each weekâ€™s folder includes both the source code and supplementary materials, such as images or videos demonstrating the program's output. The goal of these assignments is to solidify understanding of Python programming through practical, hands-on exercises.
